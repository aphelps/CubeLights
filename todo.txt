TEST
  * Verify ledInDirection(), ledAwayFrom(), and squaresOrbits() working
  * Verify that RS485 still works after changing ordering of null-constructor to prevent warning messages
  * Verify things work after cleanup of RGB and PixelUtil
  * Double tap of individual sensors
  * Convert sensor code to use a bitmask for events
  * Allow chains of light modes
    - Make arrays of modes, arguments, periods, and timers 

In YVR:
  * Write a configuration tool that runs on attached machine that takes a JSON configuration file and sends it to the HMTL module
    - Make light weight on Arduino side so that it can be included in HMTL library
  * Get Python based webserver working

* Do something to combine multiple modes

* Mode specific event handlers

* Add a method of enabling a function for a limited time

* Get MPR121 w/interrupts working

* Add Serial CLI
 
* Clockwise and counterclockwise functions

* Store Range finder in EEPROM

* Try using the timer based NewPing methods

* Play with Pi, get Henryâ€™s web app working, maybe control RGB light on test board

Hardware
--------
* Tab on the insert for the cap sensors should have a less tall bump

PCB
---
* Need diode between VCC and voltage regulator

Ideas
-----
* Transmit executable code
  - Send code via RS485, read directly into PROGMEM
  - Set function pointers to appropriate place in PROGMEM
  - Magic?
