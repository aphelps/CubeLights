In YVR:
  * Write a configuration tool that runs on attached machine that takes a JSON configuration file and sends it to the HMTL module
    - Make light weight on Arduino side so that it can be included in HMTL library
  * Get Python based webserver working
  
* BUG: Get ledInDirection(), ledAwayFrom(), and squaresOrbits() working

* Add a method of enabling a function for a limited time

* Allow chains of light modes
  - Make arrays of modes, arguments, periods, and timers

* Mode specific event handlers

* Double tap of individual sensors

* Clockwise and counterclockwise functions

* RGB class should only store three bytes

* Store Range finder in EEPROM

* Try using the timer based NewPing methods

* Add a "error only" option to Debug.h that only defines the error commands

* Play with Pi, get Henryâ€™s web app working, maybe control RGB light on test board

Hardware
--------
* Tab on the insert for the cap sensors should have a less tall bump

PCB
---
* Need diode between VCC and voltage regulator
