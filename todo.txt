TEST
  * What happens if data comes in while handling the message returned by
  rs485Util.getMsg()?  It looks like that may read new data into the buffer
  that was returned...

In YVR:
  * Write a configuration tool that runs on attached machine that takes a JSON configuration file and sends it to the HMTL module
    - Make light weight on Arduino side so that it can be included in HMTL library
  * Get Python based webserver working

* Add a method of enabling a function for a limited time
* Followup functions should not be in rotation

* Add another byte to RGB to encorporate fades?

* Function to get neighboring LED along a diaganol
* Need ability to set LED to its previous color
* Mode specific event handlers
* Get MPR121 w/interrupts working
* Add Serial CLI
* Clockwise and counterclockwise functions
* Store Range finder in EEPROM
* Try using the timer based NewPing methods
* Play with Pi, get Henryâ€™s web app working, maybe control RGB light on test board
* Refactor HMTLTypes stuff to only need to include stuff that is used.

Modes
-----
* Conway's Life
  - Normal and multiple colors
  - Make intensity a separate vector
* Simple color spread/ripples
  - Splash a color that spreads to neighbors smoothly and slowly decays
* Algorithms that affect intensity
* Algorithms that affect frequency (like blink rate)

Hardware
--------
* Tab on the insert for the cap sensors should have a less tall bump

PCB
---
* Make one designed for just a sound sensor
  - ATMega328, 3.3V regulator, RS485

Ideas
-----
* Transmit executable code
  - Send code via RS485, read directly into PROGMEM
  - Set function pointers to appropriate place in PROGMEM
  - Magic?
