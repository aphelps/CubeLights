TEST


In YVR:
  * Write a configuration tool that runs on attached machine that takes a JSON configuration file and sends it to the HMTL module
    - Make light weight on Arduino side so that it can be included in HMTL library
  * Get Python based webserver working


* Need ability to set LED to its previous color
* Mode specific event handlers
* Add a method of enabling a function for a limited time
* Get MPR121 w/interrupts working
* Add Serial CLI
* Clockwise and counterclockwise functions
* Store Range finder in EEPROM
* Try using the timer based NewPing methods
* Play with Pi, get Henryâ€™s web app working, maybe control RGB light on test board
* Refactor HMTLTypes stuff to only need to include stuff that is used.

Modes
-----
* Conway's Life
  - Normal and multiple colors
  - Make intensity a separate vector
* Simple color spread/ripples
  - Splash a color that spreads to neighbors smoothly and slowly decays
* Algorithms that affect intensity
* Algorithms that affect frequency (like blink rate)

Hardware
--------
* Tab on the insert for the cap sensors should have a less tall bump

PCB
---
* Need diode between VCC and voltage regulator

Ideas
-----
* Transmit executable code
  - Send code via RS485, read directly into PROGMEM
  - Set function pointers to appropriate place in PROGMEM
  - Magic?
