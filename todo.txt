Todo
----

* Add meta-code to all debug-only code (such as value range checks, etc)
  - Maybe as an assertion to flash lights or something

* Map the channels to the geometry

* Store thresholds in EEProm?
  - Could also store values if a scheme for cycling the address is used to prevent burnout

* Try using the timer based NewPing methods

Hardware
--------
* Tab on the insert for the cap sensors should have a less tall bump
