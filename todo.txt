Todo
----

* Add meta-code to all debug-only code (such as value range checks, etc)
  - Maybe as an assertion to flash lights or something

* Change all mode functions to only set the changes, do the update wait separately to allow for changes to the mode based on environment (intruder signal, etc)

* Map the channels to the geometry

* Store thresholds in EEProm?
  - Could also store values if a scheme for cycling the address is used to prevent burnout

* Try using the timer based NewPing methods

* Get rid of the "mode delay" and replace with in-mode time checks
