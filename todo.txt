Todo
----

* Move sensor code into separate files

* Add "print line at end" to debug printing

* Add meta-code to all debug-only code (such as value range checks, etc)
  - Maybe as an assertion to flash lights or something

* Change all mode functions to only set the changes, do the update wait separately to allow for changes to the mode based on environment (intruder signal, etc)

* Map the channels to the geometry

* Store thresholds in EEProm?
  - Could also store values if a scheme for cycling the address is used to prevent burnout

Investigate
-----------

* Does the capsense library fuck up timing?  (ie does noInterrupts() mess things up?)

* Reading directly using bits?
